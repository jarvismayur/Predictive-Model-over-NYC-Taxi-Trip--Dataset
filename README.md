## Overview

This project explores the NYC Taxi Trip dataset, performing comprehensive **EDA** to understand the data and its features. Multiple machine learning models are developed, trained, and evaluated on their predictive performance for taxi trip-related metrics. The goal is to derive actionable insights and create reliable predictive models.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes:
- **Pickup and Dropoff Times**: Time of the trip's start and end.
- **Geospatial Information**: Latitude and longitude of the pickup and dropoff locations.
- **Passenger Count**: Number of passengers in the taxi.
- **Trip Distance**: Total distance covered in the trip.

The dataset can be accessed from the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) data portal.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

During EDA, the following aspects are analyzed:
- **Trip Distribution**: Analyzing the distribution of trip distances, durations, and locations.
- **Passenger and Payment Patterns**: Insights into average trip costs, most common pickup/dropoff locations, and the impact of different variables on trip price.
- **Temporal Trends**: Investigating patterns over time (e.g., busiest hours for trips).

Visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps are used to explore these features.

## Machine Learning Models

Multiple machine learning models are applied and evaluated, including:
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Gradient Boosting**
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model is trained and validated using appropriate metrics to predict variables such as:
- Trip duration
- Trip fare amount
- Passenger count

## Results

The performance of each model is compared using metrics like:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **RÂ² Score**

The model performance is analyzed to determine which algorithm provides the most accurate predictions for different types of trips.
